# Applications authentication protocols

When an application is deployed on the platform, it is automatically created in the Identity Access Manager as a separate entity for which you can manage the **authentication protocols**. Applications include:

- **Your analytics applications**: individual AI applications that can be deployed from the [APP Manager](/en/product/app-manager/index), as well as consumers that you can connect in the [Analytics Manager](/en/product/am/consumers/index). This typically includes user-friendly interfaces to expose the data such as dashboards, reporting, or alerting tools.

- **Identity Access Manager**: accessible as an independent URL, `https://project-name.eu.dataplatform.ovh.net/iam`, the Identity Access Manager external application is used when you need users (say the administrator of a given application) to manage its user base without having to access the Platform.

For each deployed application, the platform lets you configure:
- [Application information](#application-information)
- [Authentication mode(s)](#authentication-mode) that are visible on the sign-in page
- [The style of the sign-in page](#sign-in-page-visuals): welcome message, background image, color theme, etc.

## Authentication Mode

This list allows you to manage which authentication methods are displayed on the sign-in page of the application. 

!>Â This is a pure visibility configuration and not a way to avoid users from logging into the application through certain authentication modes.
