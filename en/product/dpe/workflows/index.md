# Workflows

Workflows are basically your orchestrated ETL and data processing pipelines on the Platform. A workflow is an organizational structure in the Data Processing Engine which represents **a sequence of [actions](/en/product/dpe/actions/index)** which can be:
* Run manually or through an API call
* Scheduled to run at a given time (CRON)

---
## Create a workflow

The Platform offers a simple point-and-click interface to orchestrate your actions into scheduled workflows.

You can also go under the hood by using our integrated IDE in the Advanced mode.

## Manage workflows

In the workflows screen, you can quickly see which workflows are being run, have successfully ran or have encountered errors during their execution. 

By hovering on the *More* icon (i.e. "...") on each line of a workflow, you can also easily:
* **Delete** a workflow
* **Edit** an existing workflow
* **Run** a workflow
* **Inspect the logs** of a workflow

When the number of workflows increases, you can organise the view using *Folders* or look for a specific workflow using the search bar on the top right of the screen. To add workflows into folders, simply drag & drop a workflow inside a given folder.
