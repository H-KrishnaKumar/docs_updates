# Environments

Environments allow you to save and re-use quickly a set of [configurations and execution preferences](/en/product/dpe/actions/settings/index) in actions and workflows.

Environments are not permanent. At any time you can [change a jobs environment](/en/product/dpe/actions/settings/index) even if one had already been applied.

> If you make changes to any of the environments parameters, the changes will be reflected in all the actions and workflows to which the environment is assigned.

## Create an environment

When you first access the **Environment** tab, you will be greeted with a blank canvas for you to fill your custom environments.

Click on **New environment** and a reduced version of the [preferences](/en/product/dpe/actions/settings/index) section will appear.

From here, select your preferred *resources*, *options* and *environment variables*. Don't forget to give your environment a name and a description.
