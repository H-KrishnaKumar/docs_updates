# PostgreSQL to Parquet Action

The *PostgreSQL to Parquet* action extracts data from a PostgreSQL database and puts it into a [Parquet file](https://parquet.apache.org/) in your Project bucket. You can choose the file format.

* [Configure a PostgreSQL to Parquet action](#configure-a-postgresql-to-parquet-action)
  * [Choose a source and a destination](#choose-a-source-and-a-destination)
* [Destination file](#destination-file)

?> **Note:** This action supports the functionality to have customised date in the folder name. You can find the tutorial [here](/en/getting-further/date-in-folder-name/index.md).

## Configure a PostgreSQL to Parquet action

To create a new action, navigate to the **Action tab** of the Data Processing Engine (DPE), click on **New Action** and select the *PostgreSQL to Parquet* action.

### Choose a source and a destination

To set-up the action, start by selecting a source from the list that you have already set-up in the [Sources](/en/product/data-manager/sources/index) tab of the Data Manager.

Then, choose the *destination bucket* from the list of [Project buckets](/en/product/data-manager/buckets/index.md). 

![load-configure](picts/list-buckets.png)

### Destination file

You will then be prompted to choose the destination folder. If you leave the folder name empty, it will automatically be named as the source name.

![load-configure](picts/select-destination.png)

Your data will be put into the destination folder in a file named *part-1*. If your file is too big, it will be split into multiple files named *part-1*, *part-2*, *part-3* and so on. 

The order of your rows will be preserved in this process. Hence, the first rows will be in the *part-1* file and the following rows will be in the *part-2* file.

?> Note that this action has its **transfer speed optimised** for the PostgreSQL source.
