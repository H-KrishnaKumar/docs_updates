## Link / unlink a storage engine

A storage engine is said to be **linked** to a Project if the Project is able to connect to it (through an automated generation of credentials). 

The list of storage engines currently linked to a Project are displayed in the "Linked storage engines" table:

![LHM-settings](picts/settings-2.png)

The possible status for a linked storage engine are:
- *linking*: the storage engine instance is currently being linked to the Project
- *unlinking*: the storage engine instance is currently being unlinked from the Project
- *failed*: the storage engine instance has failed to link to the Project. Please delink it and link it again
- *updating*: the storage engine instance is linked but is currently being updated (for ex: horizontal or vertical resizing). Availability may be reduced
* *terminated*: the storage engine instance is being deleted
- green checkmark: the storage engine instance is successfully linked to the Project and fully available

### Link a storage engine
