# Dashboard

The Platform allows you to create custom analytics applications using a set of graphical components made available. The **management and organization of the restitution** is centralized in the *Dashboard* tab of an application.
This tab lets you list, add, and edit dashboards that can contain various types of content:
* Graphical representations from different extensions installed in the application

* Dynamic parameter that can be linked to graphics to make the data displayed interactive

* Static texts

* Blocks with tabs, to go from one graphic representation to another for the same data for example

* Blocks that can also contain different types of content with or without display condition

* Pop-ins activated at the click of the user

* Code integration specific to the current Project

!> The Dashboard tab will only be available once the application is deployed.
