# Extensions

Extensions are a list of packages, accessible through the extensions tab, which can provide your application with additional features, such as a third-party chart software, translation services, or dynamic parameters.

## Manage your extensions

The *Extensions* tab of the APP Manager lets you view and manage the different supported libraries: 

![app-manager-extensions](picts/app-extensions.png)


* **Add** extensions that you need for your Project
* **Configure** Global settings for the extension, where applicable
* **Delete** extensions that are already installed if they are not necessary, or if you need a new version of the library.
* **Get more information** concerning extensions linked to external libraries.
* **Import** an open-source or proprietary Project-specific or organization-specific extension

!> Adding an extension requires you to reload your app (on the Overview page) in order to be able to build it.

## Customize the extensions

Each extension within the ForePaaS marketplace has its own specific configuration in a JSON file that you can edit and customize.
