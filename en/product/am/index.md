## Component Overview

The Analytics Manager acts as a central keystone of your Project where data engineers and scientists meet analysts and front-end developers. 

It's the center point where you typically:
* [Query data from the Lakehouse Manager](/en/product/am/queries/index) by abstracting the schema and the query language
* Explore and visualize through [dashboards](/en/product/am/dashboards/index), or plugged-in [external consumers](/en/product/am/consumers/index) like Power BI.
* Expose the queried data through live API endpoints, thanks to the direct integration with the [API manager](/en/product/api-manager/index)
* View [complete execution log history](/en/product/am/history) of query executions, and [scale resources](/en/product/am/resources) linked to their queries for enhanced performances


### Manage queries
