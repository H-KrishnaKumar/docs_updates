# ForePaaS Store

The platform has been designed so that each user can create, share, and/or access pieces of work through the ForePaaS Store, at each step of the data production chain:

* **[Collect](#connectors-marketplace)** : to easily connect your data sources
* **[Transform](#dpe-marketplace)** : to work on pre-built ETL actions 
* **[Data Science](#machine-learning-marketplace)** : to leverage artificial intelligence algorithms
* **[Expose](#api-and-app-marketplace)** : to integrate widgets and dashboards templates

The ForePaaS Store gathers dozens of tools, models, templates, etc. allowing you to save time when creating analytics and AI applications.
