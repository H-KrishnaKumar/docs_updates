# Delete a Project

> You must have **project permission** `delete` in order to delete projects. These permissions are set at user level in your [organization settings](/en/product/organisations/organization-invite-user?id=manage-member-permissions-in-your-organization).


Deleting a Project **completely and permanently erases its data**. Use only when necessary!

If you are sure about deleting a Project, it can be done in 3 steps:

- [Choose the Project to delete](#choose-the-Project-to-delete)
- [Confirm decision by typing Project name](#confirm-decision-by-typing-Project-name)
- [Click on link on email received](#click-on-link-on-email-received)
