# Project Home

The Project home is the central hub of your Project. It displays all the services in the form of [Service Cards](#service-cards) that are arranged into [Sections](#sections).

In this page you can:
- Access all services in your Project.
- Add services to your Project.
- Use shortcuts to quickly go to useful pages within each service.
- View aggregate metrics of each service in one place.
- Customise the layout of the Project Home to your liking.

## Sections and Service Cards

Your service cards are grouped into sections by use case. Cards come in three sizes:
- **Small:** displays only the card's name and icon.
- **Medium:** displays the card's name, icon, two shortcut buttons and a couple of metrics or a table.
- **Large:** display  card's name, icon, two shortcut buttons, a couple of metrics and one to two tables

The size of the card can be changed by clicking on the three-dots-icon that appears upon hovering over the card (card settings).
