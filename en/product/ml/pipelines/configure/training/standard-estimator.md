# Standard estimators
Pipelines let you choose from the most popular machine learning algorithms in the industry. ForePaaS currently supports the following frameworks:

* [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
* Keras *(coming soon!)*

> If you cannot find the algorithm of your choice among the standard estimators, you can also upload your own script using the **custom estimator** option.

## Add a standard estimator

Selecting *Standard estimator* will open the store catalog where you can choose the algorithm you want to use for your model.

Depending on your use case, you need to choose between a [classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification) and a [regressor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis). You can know what category is each algorithm by looking at their tags.

## Change your pipeline's estimator

You can change the estimator at the core of your pipeline by clicking the **Change** button on the Training page.

!> Changing the estimator of your pipeline will completely erase the configuration for the [Training](/en/ml/pipelines/configure/training/index) and [Tuning](/en/ml/pipelines/configure/tuning/index) steps, including all previous hyper-parameter combinations generated in the studio. It will **not** delete saved models generated by the previous estimator.

## Manage libraries and dependencies

The Dependencies panel lets you manage all packages requirements for the execution of your pipeline.

## Configure scoring and validation

After choosing the base algorithm at the core of your model, you need to be able to evaluate it in an unbiased fashion. Learn how to set validation and scoring functions:
