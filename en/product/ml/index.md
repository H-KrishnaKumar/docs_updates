# Machine Learning Manager

>**Please note:** This service is only available on the *Legacy ForePaaS Platform and ML is not accessible to to OVHcloud Data Platform users*.

The Machine Learning Manager lets you **train and deploy AI models into production**. It offers different ways to get started with machine learning. You can either start by experimenting on [notebooks](en/product/ml/notebooks/index), train prediction models from scratch in [pipelines](en/product/ml/pipelines/index), or even deploy an externally trained [model](/en/product/ml/models/index) file.

## Component overview

The Machine Learning Manager enables you to **put models into production for AI-powered applications**. Like all other components on ForePaaS, it is based on the containers and micro-services technology. This means that individual ML jobs including training, scoring and predictions can be scaled to adapt to a large volume of processed data and high-frequency data throughput. 

Once it is created, any model can either be used:
* in the **Data Processing Engine (DPE)** to write predictions in your ForePaaS data model.
* as an **external API**.

Inside the Machine Learning Manager you will be able to perform the following actions:
* [Create notebooks](en/product/ml/notebooks/index) and use them to explore your data
* [Set up pipelines to train new ML models](en/product/ml/pipelines/index) from scratch
* [Compare & deploy models](/en/product/ml/models/index) as well as uploading and sharing existing models leveraging a public/private marketplace
