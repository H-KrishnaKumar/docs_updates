# Homepage
As long as you are part of an Organisation that has Projects, everytime you log-in to the Platform you will be welcomed into the platform at the Homepage (shown below).

This page is the central hub that shows all the your Projects within an organisation and allows you to easily navigate to any service in the platform. 

![organisation overview](picts/orga_home_numbered.png)

> The Homepage is specific to a single organisation and if you are a part of multiple organisations, you will have one homepage per organisation. You can swap organisations in the [Header](/en/navigation/header/index.md) and upon logging-in you will arrive at the homepage of the last organisation you accessed.

## Widgets

![widgets](picts/widgets.png)

Widgets are snippets of data about your organisation and Projects shown to you here so you can be sure to catch critical information such as compute and storage consumption without having to look for it. They are **specific to your user account** and not your organisation so any change you make to your widgets will not affect your teammates' widgets.

### Manage Widgets

![manage widgets](picts/manage_widgets.png)

Via the *Manage Widgets* menu you can add new wigets or hide the widget section entirely if you do not wish to see them.

## Back to recent work
Services that you accessed recently appear in this section along with their preoject. The list is updated everytime you access a new service.
