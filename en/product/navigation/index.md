# Homepage and navigation

Upon logging-in, you will arrive at the [Platform Home](/en/product/navigation/homepage.md) (or Homepage). Furthermore, from any page in the platform (including the Home) you have access to the two main ways to quickly move around: the [Sidebar](/en/product/navigation/sidebar.md)
 and the [Header](/en/product/navigation/header.md).


## Homepage

 This is the central hub of the platform where you can see all your [Projects](/en/product/project/index.md) and easily go anywhere in the platform.

## Sidebar
The sidebar allows you to **navigate per service**, i.e. select which service you want to go to and than the Project you want to open it in. You can also find your [Favorites](/en/product/navigation/sidebar.md?id=favorites) in the Sidebar.

## Header
The Header on the other hand allows you to **navigate per Project**, i.e. select which Project you want to go to and than the service you want to open within the Project.
