# Discover the key concepts in the Data Catalog

?> The Data Catalog, being the central repository for all your data assets on the platform, is one of the most critical components in your Project. With the ease to connect, extract your data,the Platform allows you to **understand your data well at an early stage**. This will help you start progressing on it, rather than spending a lot of time just to clean and manage the infrastructure of your data. 

The Data Catalog component has 3 submenus, corresponding to its main features:

* **Overview** giving information on the various data sources (like their distribution, issues related to them, associated blueprint rules, execution analysis)

* [**Sources**](en/product/data-catalog/sources/index) to connect external data from any of the supported sources. You can either import the data into your the Platform Project, or, for compatible connectors, directly query this source for analytics purposes.

* [**Analyzer**](en/product/data-catalog/analyzer/index) to extract the metadata of your sources and apply basic cleaning rules to them

* **Jobs** to give all users an overall overview of all the jobs and their status


Within the Data Catalog, once you have collected your [sources](en/product/data-catalog/sources/index), you can [analyze](en/product/data-catalog/analyzer/index) them by extracting their metadata and by applying data cleaning rules (called [blueprint rules](en/product/data-catalog/analyzer/add-blueprint-rules)) to improve your data quality. These rules will be automatically applied by the [Data Processing Engine](/en/product/dpe/index), whenever a job on a data source is executed.


Next, through the **Jobs** tab, you will be able to view the summary of your job performances. It provides you with quick hand information like status of jobs, jobs run overtime, jobâ€™s runtime, also running jobs, queued jobs, past jobs executed.
