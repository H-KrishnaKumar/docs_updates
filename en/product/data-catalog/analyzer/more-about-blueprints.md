# More about Blueprint Rules

### Rule format

A rule applies to each line independently and allows several things.

If a condition is specified, the rule will apply only under certain conditions expressed in condition and condition_value(s).

If a transformation is filled, the transformation action on each line will be performed, otherwise, it is considered to be a filtering rule. (keep)


### Conditions List

If no *condition* is filled, the one set by default will be ALL, and allows any line


### Transformation List
If no *transformation* nor *condition* is filled, then we consider it to be a *default transformation*. 
Otherwise, if no action is filled and there is one *condition*, the action by default is *keep*. 
The action applies only to lines that respond to the rule defined by *condition*.
