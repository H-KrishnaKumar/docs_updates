# Data Catalog

The Data Catalog is the **central repository for all your Project's data Sources**.

It allows you to manage all your sources by letting you connect to your [data sources](en/product/data-catalog/sources/index), [analyze](en/product/data-catalog/analyzer/index) them, and add [blueprint rules](en/product/data-catalog/analyzer/add-blueprint-rules) for setting formatting standards.

As the Data Catalog is one of the main components and has vast features, it can be a little difficult for first-timers to understand its full usage well. 

Fortunately, we have prepared a detailed tutorial explaining each sub-component!
