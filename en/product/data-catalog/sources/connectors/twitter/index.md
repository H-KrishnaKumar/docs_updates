You can for instance get data from competitors' accounts.

## Get your access credentials

To access the X API you will need first to create an application on X. Then the tokens will be generated from it.

As the connector is using X's public API, you donâ€™t need to create this app from a specific account with specific rights.

### Step 1
Go on [X](https://apps.X.com/) and click on Â«Â Create New AppÂ Â».

![App Page](picts/twitter1.png)

### Step 2
Fill the form with your own information all the mandatory fields.
*Do not forget the Developer Agreement*.

### Step 3
Go on the Â«Â Keys and Access TokensÂ Â» tab.

### Step 4
Go on Â«Â Your Access TokenÂ Â» and click on Â«Â Create my access tokenÂ Â».

### Step 5
Open a Text Editor software and copy/paste your Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token and Access Token Secret.

## Add a X source on the Platform

### Configuration screen overview

Once you have found *X* in the **Platform store**, click on *Select* and you will be able to see the configuration screen as shown below:

![twitter_conf](picts/twitter_conf.png)

### Configuring your source

#### Connect to X

When creating the source, you will be required to input the following information :

- **Account**: your X Page ID.
- **Consumer key**: key provided by X (you copied it earlier).
- **Consumer secret**: secret associated to the Consumer key.
- **Access token**: your X API access token.
- **Access token secret**: the secret associated to the Access token.
- **Source default schema**: you can use this field to add columns to your data, if necessary. Use the following syntax *{"name":"value"}*, where *name* is the name of your column and *value* is the value to be filled in all rows.

Once you add the above details click on *Connect* to establish a connection with X's API.

#### Add the Accounts and Endpoints

Before moving on, you have to add accounts and endpoints.

* [Accounts](#how-to-add-an-account) are X pages referenced by the Page ID - just like in the previous screen - which you want to get data from.
* [Endpoints](#how-to-add-an-endpoint) are the **different types of data** about accounts that the Platform will get using the X API. Each endpoint corresponds to a final table, aggregating data for all selected *accounts*.

![twitter_conf2](picts/twitter_conf2.png)

?> The Platform will use the credentials given to access the X API but **you can overwrite the credentials** to have multiple accounts and endpoints in the same source. Simply add the different accounts to the Source after the [Connect to X](#connect-to-X) step.

##### How to add an account?

To add an account, click on *Add an Account*. This will open the following window:

![add_account](picts/add_account.png)

By default, it is using the same credentials you wrote previously when establishing the connection, which you can overwrite here. The *account name* is the internal display name.

##### How to add an Endpoint?

On the Platform, each registered endpoint will correspond to a data source object, which you will be able to [load](/en/product/dpe/actions/load/index) into a distinct [table](/en/product/lakehouse-manager/tables/index). 

To add an endpoint, click on *Add an Endpoint*. This will open the following window:

![twitter_endpoint](picts/twitter_endpoint.png)

Next, select the type of Endpoint you wish to add. The team is always adding new types of Endpoints to the connectors. You can click on the scroll-down list under the *Type* field to see the ones available.  

Most common ones are:
- *tweet_insights*: general data about the page.
- *account_insights*: data about the page sorted by day.

To finish, click on the *Create* button on the top right-hand corner.

!> Don't forget to name your source before creating it. The technical name cannot be changed after creating the source and will be used when trying to open the source using the [SDK](/en/technical/sdk/dpe/index).
