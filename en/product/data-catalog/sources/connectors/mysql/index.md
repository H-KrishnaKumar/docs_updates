## Add a MySQL source on the Platform

### Configure your connection

When creating the source, you will be required to input the following information :

- **Host**: the host name of the MySQL database.
- **Port**: the port address of the MySQL database.
- **Database**: the name of the MySQL database.
- **Username**: the user name for the MySQL database.
- **Password**: the password for the Username you are using.
- **SSL**: if activated, encrypts the information exchanged between the browser and the database.

### Select the tables you want

After establishing a connection with your MySQL database your tables will be fetched and displayed :

Select which tables you want to be included in the source by checking the boxes to the left of the table name, as indicated in the image above.

?> If the state of the database changes, you can use the *Fetch* button to refresh the tables displayed and include them in your source.

Once you follow the steps above, click on the *Create* button on the top right-hand corner.


!> Don't forget to name your source before creating it. The technical name cannot be changed after creating the source and will be used when trying to open the source using the [SDK](/en/technical/sdk/dpe/index).
