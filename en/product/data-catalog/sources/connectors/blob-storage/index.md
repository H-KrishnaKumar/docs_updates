## Get your access credentials from Azure

You need to obtain the following information from Azure:
- the name of the Azure storage account to connect to
- a key for this storage account
- the name of the blob container to connect to

### Get your storage account name and key

On the Microsoft Azure console, open the **storage account** that you want to connect to and open the *Access keys* tab.

Retrieve the following information:
- *storage account name*
- *key*

!> If you are on a [Dedicated plan](/en/product/billing/plans/add-subscription) with a self-hosted cluster, you shouldn't connect to the resource group/storage account dedicated to the Platform resources. 

If you don't have a separate storage account yet, use the below documentation to create one.

#### Create a new storage account

To create a new [Microsoft Azure storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview?toc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Ftoc.json) from the Microsoft Azure console, select *Storage accounts* and click on **Create**.

Follow the steps to add a storage account filling in the required fields and custom settings. The *storage account name* will be needed to connect from the Platform.

Once your storage account is created, go back to the first steps up above to retrieve its name and key.


### Get your blob container name

In the Microsoft Azure console, open the *Storage browser* tab.

In the service account you just used, open the section *Blob containers*.

If you have an existing container that you want to use, retrieve its *name* at this step. Else, create a new container.


#### Create a new blob container

Click on **Add container**. The *name* you fill in will be needed to connect from the Platform.

### Configuring your source

#### Connect to Microsoft Azure Blob Storage

When creating the source, you will be required to input the following information :

- **Account name**: the name of the storage account obtained [here](#get-your-storage-account-name-and-key)
- **Account key**: the key for this storage account obtained [here](#get-your-storage-account-name-and-key)
- **Container name**: the name of the blob container obtained [here](#get-your-blob-container-name)
- **Path of files** *(optional)*: the full path of a specific folder or file to connect to

Once you add the above details click on **Connect** to establish a connection with Microsoft Azure Blob Storage. 

?>Â If everything works successfully, you should see the list of parsed files appearing on the page. This may take up to a few seconds.

To finish, click on the **Create** button on the top right-hand corner.

!> Don't forget to name your source before creating it. The technical name cannot be changed after creating the source and will be used when trying to access the source using the [SDK](/en/technical/sdk/dpe/index).
