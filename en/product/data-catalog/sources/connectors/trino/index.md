## Add a Trino source on the Platform

### Configure your connection

When creating the source, you will be required to input the following information :

- **Host**: the Host name of the Trino server.
- **Port**: the Port address of the Trino server *(8080 by default)*.
- **Catalog**: the name of the catalog from the Trino server.
- **Schema**: the name of the Schema from the Trino server.
- **Username**: the Username for the Trino server.
- **Password**: the Password for the Username you are using.
- **SSL**: if activated, encrypts the information exchanged between the browser and the database.

### Select the tables you want

After establishing a connection with your Trino Server your tables will be fetched and displayed :

Select which tables you want to be included in the source by checking the boxes to the left of the table name, as indicated in the image above.

?> If the state of the database changes, you can use the *Fetch* button to refresh the tables displayed and include them in your source.

Once you follow the steps above, click on the *Save* button on the top right-hand corner.


!> Don't forget to name your source before creating it. The technical name cannot be changed after creating the source and will be used when trying to open the source using the [SDK](/en/technical/sdk/dpe/index).

## Connect Trino to an existing Platform Project

You can use **Trino** as a connector to an existing project on the Platform. This will be useful in the scenario where there is a need to extract data from one project to another. The tutorial can be found [here](/en/getting-further/trino-connector/index).
