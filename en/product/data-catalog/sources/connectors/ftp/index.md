# FTP

TheÂ File Transfer ProtocolÂ (FTP) is a standardÂ network protocolÂ used for the transfer ofÂ computer filesÂ betweenÂ a client and serverÂ on aÂ computer network.
The Platform allows you to connect to an FTP server, select your files on it, and import their data directly into your platform.

### Supported files and sizes

Before you proceed with learning how to configure an FTP source, it would be interesting to note that - 

* Even though our FTP connector is able to list every file on your server, keep in mind that meta/data extraction only support the following types: .csv, .xls, .xlsx, .xml, .json, .parquet

* For the Metadata Extraction (see the Analyze part of our data catalog guide), the actual limits of size for a file downloaded by our FTP connector are:
 * Complete Extract: about 900 Mo
 * Sample Extract: about 2.5 Go


### Configuring your source

When creating the source, you will be required to input the following information :


- Host: The URL/IP of the FTP server you want to connect to (ex: 127.0.0.1)
- Port: The port listened to by your FTP server (21 by default for most FTP servers)
- Username: The login used to authenticate
- Password: The password associated
- Path: The path needed to find your files on the server (ex: Documents/data/export_2018.csv)


Once you add the above details click on *Connect* and then on the *Create* button on the top right-hand corner.



!> Don't forget to name your source before creating it. The technical name cannot be changed after creating the source and will be used when trying to open the source using the [SDK](/en/technical/sdk/dpe/index).
