## Data Platform IP Whitelisting for External Database Access

To ensure secure access to your external database from our platform, it may be necessary to authorize specific IP addresses. You can whitelist the following IP address in your database configuration to allow seamless and secure communication:

### IP Address to Whitelist:
`51.210.213.114`

### Steps to Whitelist:
1. **Access Database Configuration**:  
   Log in to your database management or security settings where you manage network access.

2. **Locate the IP Whitelisting Section**:  
   Find the section for managing authorized IP addresses, often under "Security" or "Firewall" settings.

3. **Add the IP Address**:  
   Enter `51.210.213.114` into the list of allowed or trusted IP addresses.

4. **Save and Apply Changes**:  
   After adding the IP address, save your changes and apply them to ensure proper access.

By whitelisting this IP, you enable secure communication between the platform and your database while maintaining robust security measures.
