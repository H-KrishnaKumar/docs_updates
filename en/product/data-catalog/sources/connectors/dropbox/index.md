### Configuring your source

When creating the source, you will be required to input the following information :

- Token: The access key to your app (generated in the previous step).
- Path: The path to the folder.

?> If the token is an application token linked to a folder, you don't need to put anything in the Path field ðŸ’¡

Once you add the above details click on *Connect* and then on the *Create* button on the top right-hand corner.

!> Don't forget to name your source before creating it. The technical name cannot be changed after creating the source and will be used when trying to open the source using the [SDK](/en/technical/sdk/dpe/index).
