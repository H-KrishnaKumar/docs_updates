# Create or join an organization
Organizations are the compartmentalized teams that link individual members, Dataplants and plans together. You can have as many teammates in your organization as you want. 

Your organization can work on multiple data projects at the same time. Each project is carried out inside a [Dataplant](/en/product/dataplant/index.md): you can create as many as you want.

> To create or join an organization, make sure that you already have a [ForePaaS user account](/en/product/account-setup/index.md)

## Join an existing organization
To join an organization that already exists (if your team already has one, for example), you need to ask someone already on there to invite you.
