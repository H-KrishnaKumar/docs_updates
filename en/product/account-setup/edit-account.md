You can also see the list of organizations you are part of, as well as organizations where you might have potential teammates based on your email domain. You can request to join those organizations by clicking on the corresponding **Request to join** button. *Admins* of this organization will receive an email and will have to [manually approve your application](/en/product/account-setup/organization-invite-user?id=accept-or-deny-requests-to-join-your-forepaas-organization).
