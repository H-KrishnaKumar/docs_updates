# Profile and organizations

Creating your own user profile is the first necessary step in order to use ForePaaS. It can be done in under 5 minutes and is **completely free**!

You can then create or join an **organization**: it is a workspace shared with your teammates to work on projects. Once you are part of an organization, you can create [Dataplants](/en/product/dataplant/index) which are dedicated environments where you can carry out specific data projects. Each Dataplant usually represents one project.

> üí° ForePaaS charges at the organization level through the purchase of a subscription plan.

## Activate a subscription for your organization

**ForePaaS doesn't charge per user or Dataplant, but for an organization's subscription plan and consumption**. You can purchase a subscription for your organization by yourself through your [Billing Account](en/product/billing/account/index).

## Create your first Dataplant

A Dataplant is like a mini-factory to build AI projects and applications. It contains all the necessary components from raw extraction to restitution. Dataplants individually have a set of dedicated resources that can be allocated freely depending on the needs of your project.
