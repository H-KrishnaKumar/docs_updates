## Quotas

?> This feature is coming soon!

Quotas are restrictions that are set automatically for all organizations. They constitute safeguards against accidental over-consumption and are imposed by all cloud providers.  
Think of them as an equivalent of the quotas your bank can impose on the maximum withdrawal or payment amount per week.  


> You cannot modify quotas by yourself. To do so, submit your request on the quotas page. A ForePaaS expert will get back to you shortly!

## Plan
The Plan tab is where you can **manage your subscription plan**. It shows all the features included in your current plan, as well as the option to upgrade it.  

- In *Billing*, you can get the details of your next invoice with a breakdown of the month-to-date balance per cost category.
- In *Receipts*, you can download past invoices as PDFs.

## Settings

The Settings tab is the place where you'll manage:
- **basic information** about your organization: name, description, multi-factor authentication requirements, and plan cancellation. This is also where you can manage the option to let users with the same email domain as people in your organization to request to join it.
- **infrastructure** options: domain name and certificates. You can customize domain names for your applications deployed on ForePaaS, and create SSH certificates to access your secure domain names.
Adding your certificate, you'll need a server certificate (.crt file) or key (.key).
