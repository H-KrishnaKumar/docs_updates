## Data Platform design philosophy

Data Platform enables organizations (whole companies, business units, departments, or individuals) to create and deploy robust and scalable cloud-native AI applications while leveraging the latest cloud technologies, architectures and software.


When we set out to create the Platform, we followed a simple design philosophy: **to offer an elegant solution that enables users to take on any data challenge and accelerate the application development cycle**. Following this inspiration, we designed a platform that hides technical complexities, and removes the need to make uncertain technological decisions or bend over backward to make them work, through 4 simple levels of automation:

When working with the Platform, organizations create their own personal environments called [Projects](/en/product/project/index). Projects host all your data processes, models, algorithms and web applications. The physical data, in turn, is stored in a [storage engine](/en/product/project/storage-engine/index).

?> Access to the Projects is usually shared collaboratively, following **user access levels** defined by your organization. For example, a first group of users can be working on data access and transformation, another on the AI models, and a third on the web application interface.

A Project contains **all the components you need to manage your data's life cycle**, processes and rules and user access rights to make your data Projects a success. All these components are included in the illustration below. You can click on a component to learn more about it, or simply follow the guideâ€™s logical flow, which will help you use the Platform in the most helpful way.
