# Organizations and user profiles

Organizations are the compartmentalized teams that link individual users (or members) and [Projects](/en/product/project/index.md) as well as their services together. You can have as many teammates in your organization as you want and everyone in the organization must have [user profile](/en/product/organisations/profile.md) to use the platform.

Your organization can work on multiple [Projects](/en/product/project/index.md) at the same time and you can create as many as you want.

> To create or join an organization, make sure that you already have a [User Profile](/en/product/organisations/profile.md).
