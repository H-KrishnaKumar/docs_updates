## Signup using an local Data Platform account

!> To use this option, it is **required to [have been invited](/en/product/iam/users/users?id=manage-organization-iam-users) in an existing Data Platform Organization** by an admin from your company beforehand. Consequently, at least one person in your organization needs to have signed up [using an OVHcloud account](/en/product/organisations/create-account?id=signup-using-an-ovhcloud-account).

If you are joining people from your organization that are already signed-up on the platform, you can fill out the form to signup to the platform using a email & password combination.
