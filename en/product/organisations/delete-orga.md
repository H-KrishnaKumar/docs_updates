# Delete an organization

Deleting an organization ensures that all resources associated in this organization are **permanently deleted**. It is not possible to recover an organization that has been deleted.

To delete an organization there is a checklist to be followed. In the chance that you miss out on something in the checklist, you will not be allowed to delete the organization.  
All following 5 steps must be completed for an organization to be deleted:

1. [Delete all projects](/en/product/project/delete_project) within the organization
2. [Delete all storage engines](/en/product/project/storage-engine/index?id=delete-a-storage-engine) from the organization
3. Make sure there is no pending balance on [billing](/en/product/billing/account/index)
4. [Remove all users](/en/product/organisations/organization-invite-user?id=remove-members-from-your-organization) from the organization
5. Delete the organization *(see documentation below)*
