# User Profile Guide

Creating your own user profile is the first necessary step in order to use the platform. You can then create or join an [Organization](/en/product/organisations/index.md)

An [Organization](/en/product/organisations/index.md) us a workspace shared with your teammates to work on Projects. Once you are part of an [Organization](/en/product/organisations/index.md), you can create [Projects](/en/product/project/index) which are dedicated environments that assemble multiple services together and can answer one or more use cases.

### 2.4 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA adds an additional layer of security by requiring a second form of verification (e.g., a code sent to your mobile phone or an authenticator app). You can enable or disable MFA here.

For detailed instructions on how to configure and manage Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for your account, please refer to the dedicated MFA setup documentation. The document provides a step-by-step guide on enabling MFA, setting up an authenticator app or SMS-based authentication, and securely handling backup codes.

You can find the complete MFA documentation at the following location: [MFA Setup and Configuration Guide](#/en/product/organisations/mfa-setup.md).

It is highly recommended that all users review the MFA documentation to ensure their accounts are adequately protected.
