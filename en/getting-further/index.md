# Getting further: tutorials and how tos

Hello again! 👋 We are so excited to see you want to step up your Project development.  

The **Getting Further** guide series will enable you to discover the most advanced features and harness the full potential of the Platform. 


Depending on the kind of person that you are, you might be interested in different features. While the [Getting Started](/en/getting-started/index.md) guide only covers a fraction of the Platforms' possibilities, there is so much more you can achieve with our platform.

## Getting further tutorials

The purpose of the **Getting Further** series of tutorials is to show you advanced examples and use cases about different aspects of the platform. Code snippets and boilerplates are provided throughout the tutorials to make it easy and straightforward for you. Nonetheless, we recommend that you spend time exploring the platform's options by yourself. Remember that you can refer to the [Product Guide](/en/product/index) for an exhaustive description of each component of the platform at any time.

At this point, you should have set up an entire system that streamlines Chicago transit data from its sourcing to its visualization. If you haven't, we suggest you go through our [Getting Started](/en/getting-started/index.md) guide and set up your first application. This app will be the cornerstone for the more advanced examples we are about to guide you through.
