# Apply segmentation to your jobs

[Segmentation](en/product/dpe/actions/settings/segmentation) will allow you to unleash the Data Processing Engine's power of scalability. When executed, your [actions](/en/product/dpe/actions/index) will be **split into multiple tasks**, each task will manage a smaller dataset.

?> With great power comes with great responsibility: segmentation options should be configured carefully. Depending on your segmentation choices, your action may be much faster... or much slower.  

There are several ways to configure segmentation depending on the action and/or the type of source you are using. Take note of the specific configuration details in each of the corresponding chapters below:

- [Based on the values of an attribute of a reference table](/en/getting-further/segmentation/index?id=segmentation-over-the-values-of-a-table-attribute)
- [Based on the values in a predefined set](/en/getting-further/segmentation/index?id=segmentation-over-a-predefined-set-of-values)
- [Based on the date perimeter of the workflow](/en/getting-further/segmentation/index?id=segmentation-over-the-date-perimeter-set-in-the-workflow)
- [Based on a fix number of lines](/en/getting-further/segmentation/index?id=segmentation-by-chunking-a-source)
- [Based on files](/en/getting-further/segmentation/index?id=segmentation-over-same-structured-files)
- [Based on the source's accounts](/en/getting-further/segmentation/index?id=segmentation-over-source-accounts)
