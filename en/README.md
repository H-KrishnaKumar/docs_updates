# Welcome to the documentation portal! 

This portal aims to present the features and developer references for **OVHcloud Data Platform**, an end-to-end unified analytics platform.

Features only available in one of the offerings will be clearly marked as such throughout this portal.

## Discovering the platform

Let’s face it; building a data-intensive application — from internal reporting dashboards to real-time consumer-facing apps — is a very complex and daunting task.  

The platform **hides all the technical complexities generated by your project and automatically manages them for you**, helping you focus on your business requirements and value. It will accelerate by 10x your project time-to-delivery, compared to other tools and platforms.

The platform is **fully cloud-native** in its approach to building, deploying, and managing modern applications in cloud computing environments. It allows modern software teams to make highly scalable, flexible, and resilient analytics applications on which they can iterate quickly.  
By using the platform, you can focus on building software products instead of worrying about the underlying infrastructure. It also offers you the option to deploy your project on-premise within your own servers, offering you complete leeway in the way you define your cloud architecture, and manage your data operations.
