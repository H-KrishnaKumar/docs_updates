# ForePaaS Store API Reference

The [ForePaaS Store](/en/product/dataplant/marketplace) is the collaborative space on the platform where each organization's member can create, share, and/or access code templates and packages.

Each marketplace (application templates, API extensions, etc..) has [its own endpoints](/en/technical/api-reference/store/index?id=list-of-all-store-apis). They all start with:

```
https://store.forepaas.io/
```

After getting an authorization token, **creating a package in the store is done in 2 steps**:
1. create the package in the correct marketplace
2. upload a ZIP file containing the code for the first version

The same API endpoints are used to update package information and version.

## Getting an authorization token

For each call referenced below, you will need an **authorization token**. 

!>Â You must have a [ForePaaS account](/en/product/organisations/profile.md), and be part of at least one [organization](/en/product/organisations/index.md) to be able to upload packages and version.

To get an authorization token, 

1. Open the ForePaaS Platform and open a Project
2. Open the **browser console** (*Ctrl + Shift + C* on Google Chrome)
3. From the App's panel, choose **+** to open the new application dialog box
4. In the browser's console, go to **Network tab** and filter for *store.forepaas.io*
5. There should be one GET for `https://store.forepaas.io/v1`
5. Right click and **Copy as cURL**, that contains Authorization token and will serve as basis for next Store API calls.

## Create or update a package

Create/update a package in your **private store**, meaning only the members of your [organization](/en/product/organisations/index.md) will be able to see it.

> It is currently impossible to upload a package to the public store.

The following reference shows how to upload a package for the *App templates*. See [below](/en/technical/api-reference/store/index?id=list-of-all-store-apis) the list of all APIs for other marketplaces.

## Tips and Troubleshooting

* when package is hosted in a Git repository, keep the JSON describing the package as a dedicated source file.
* make sure the `<VERSION_ID>` is a usual version number such as `1.0.0` for instance.  
By default, ForePaaS Store will deliver latest version based on version ordering.
* make sure that ZIP file contains only source files and not intermediate code or Git folders (such as `.git` or `node_modules` for instance)
* make sure the ZIP file meets package expectation.  
For instance, in App's template, a common mistake is to have a *root folder* inside the ZIP file rather than the contents at the root of the ZIP archive.
