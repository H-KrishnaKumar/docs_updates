# Developer Documentation

Welcome to the **ForePaaS Platform technical developer documentation**! 
Your data Projects can be driven from end to end using code on ForePaaS.

In this guide, you will learn how to use the platform’s micro-service architecture to fully customize and configure almost any component using our **ForePaaS API references** and **the Software Development Kits (SDK)**.

?> This guide is intended for advanced technical users who want to develop a high level of customization, or leverage existing work and integrate it with the ForePaaS Platform.
