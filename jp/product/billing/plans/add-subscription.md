# Get a subscription plan

Each [organization](/jp/product/account-setup/index) must have an active subscription plan in order to be able to create new projects.

ForePaaS has 3 pricing plans: *Standard*, *Premium*, and *Dedicated*.

#### Choose a plan

You will be asked to choose one of the subscription plans.

#### Choose a support level

#### Optional: reserve resources

You then have the possibility to purchase [committed resources](jp/product/billing/resources/committed.md) for your organization. Committed resources enable you to reserve resources annually at a discounted rate.

This step is completely optional.

#### Choose a billing account

Subscriptions (as well as any subsequent additional resources consumption) are invoiced through a [billing account](/jp/product/billing/account/index.md). The initial linked billing account is the account of the person purchasing the subscription, though the ownership of a billing account can later be transferred to another user.

If you have never purchased anything on ForePaaS, a billing account will be created automatically as you click on **New account**. You will then be prompted to enter a payment method and a billing address.

If you already own one or more billing accounts on ForePaaS, you can use either one of them or create a new one.

![billing](picts/sub-existing-account.png)

Enter a payment method if you are creating a new account, or verify the payment method of your existing account. You have to enter a payment method even if you are activating the free-trial of a standard subscription: you will only be charged at the end of the free-trial period provided your subscription is still active then.

> If you are a European Union resident and wish to use automatic SEPA transfers as your payment method, please reach out to our support team.

![billing](picts/sub-payment-existing.png)

Enter your billing address and information, or verify them if you are using an existing account.

!> Changing the billing information (or primary payment method) of an existing billing account will also change it for all the active subscriptions of this account.

#### Confirm your order

Finally, review your order and press **Confirm** to activate your subscription.

![billing](picts/sub-confirm.png)

Congratulations! You are now able to [begin your first data project on ForePaaS](/jp/product/dataplant/create-dataplant).

At any moment, you can also manage your organization's subscriptions and invoicing by going to [the Organization menu](/jp/product/account-setup/organization-settings.md?id=plan).
